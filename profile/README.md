## 👋 Welcome to ExtraCodes

Welcome to the **ExtraCodes** organization! This platform is designed as a dedicated space for members of our Discord community to share code snippets, ideas, and resources. It functions similarly to GitHub Gists but is specifically tailored to meet the needs of our community. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, ExtraCodes is here to help you collaborate, share knowledge, and grow together.
